								<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
								<p class="tagline">ENGINEER AND BUILDER</p>
								<p>I’m Shrey, an Engineering 1 student at McMaster University who thrives on building systems where mechanical design, electronics, and intelligent software come together. I gravitate toward problems that intersect robotics, automation, and data, where thoughtful engineering decisions can turn theory into systems that actually move, sense, and adapt in the real world.</p>
								<p>Through my work with robotics teams and research labs, I’ve designed and tested mechanical components, supported experimental automation, and contributed to projects involving computer vision, control, and hardware–software integration. Most recently, I am conducting biomechanics research with a distinguished professor and McMaster University and am a Mechanical Team Member with the McMaster Mars Rover Team, where I am excited to continue developing robust mechanical systems and collaborating across disciplines to solve complex, real-world engineering challenges.</p>
								<p>Outside of formal projects, I’m often experimenting with mechanical systems and electromechanical assemblies, tuning control logic, and analyzing sensor data to better understand how physical designs respond in real-world conditions. If it involves robotics, mechanisms, or closing the loop between the digital and physical worlds, I’m in.</p>

					          <p class="long-desc">As a Biomechanics Research Fellow under Professor Ravi Selvaganapathy, I am designing and building a robotic arm system to automate radiopharmaceutical processing and testing. This involves integrating precision actuators, sensors, and custom hardware to improve the efficiency, accuracy, and repeatability of complex laboratory experiments. By creating a system capable of handling delicate procedures, I am helping reduce human error and streamline workflows in a highly regulated research environment.</p>
					          <p class="long-desc">I am developing and implementing Python pipelines to control the robotic system, collect experimental data, and perform real-time analysis for quality assurance. This includes creating automated routines for task execution, programming data logging processes, and implementing checks to ensure experimental consistency. Through these efforts, I am enabling the lab to generate reliable, high-quality data while supporting advanced experimental protocols that would be challenging to perform manually.</p>  
							  <p class="long-desc">I am collaborating closely with a multidisciplinary team of graduate students and engineering faculty to plan experiments, troubleshoot technical issues, and optimize the robotic system’s performance. In addition, I contribute to producing detailed technical reports, data visualizations, and presentations, translating complex experimental results into actionable insights. This collaborative work enhances the lab’s ability to make data-driven decisions, improves the reproducibility of experiments, and supports ongoing innovation in robotic automation for biomedical research.</p>
